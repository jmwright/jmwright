## About Me

I am a core contributor to the [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) programmatic CAD project. I also create open hardware and work on other open engineering tools. Many of my hardware projects can be found on [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/7BIndustries), and more information can be found on my open source company's website: [7B Industries](https://7bindustries.com/). Below are a few notable projects that I have created and/or work on. If you would like to support my open source work, you can contribute using [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jmwright), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jmwright), [LiberaPay](liberapay.com/jmwright/) and [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/7bindustries).

## Open Source Software
* [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Python CAD API which allows creation of highly parametric CAD models and assemblies.
* [CQ-editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor) - CadQuery GUI editor based on PyQT that supports Linux, Windows and Mac.
* [cq-cli](https://github.com/CadQuery/cq-cli) - Command Line Interface for executing CadQuery scripts and writing their output to another format, often used on servers.
* [opc-build-system](https://github.com/CadQuery/ocp-build-system) - Repository and Continuous Integration configs to build Python wheels for OCP, which makes it possible to install CadQuery from PyPI using pip.
* [assembly-mesh-plugin](https://github.com/CadQuery/assembly-mesh-plugin) - CadQuery plugin to create a Gmsh mesh of an assembly with corresponding data.
* [cadquery-freecad-workbench](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery-freecad-workbench) - FreeCAD workbench that allows the Macro Editor to execute and display CadQuery models.

## Open Hardware
* [Stereoscope](https://codeberg.org/7BIndustries/poc-stereoscope) - Depth perception attachment for wildlife camera traps that allows wildlife populations to be more accurately determined.
* [Nimble](https://github.com/Wakoma/nimble/tree/smart_doc) - Wakoma.co project to automatically generate CAD and documentation for their portable internet-in-a-box system.
* [Push Button Switch](https://codeberg.org/7BIndustries/push-button-switch) - Switch created using 3D printing which allows a user to control a computer by pushing the button.
* [3D Printed Braille Labels](https://codeberg.org/7BIndustries/braille-label-generator) - Converts English text to a braille label which can be 3D printed ([Try It](https://7bindustries.com/hardware/braille_download.html)).
